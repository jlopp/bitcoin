Statoshi: Bitcoin Core + statistics logging
=====================================

What is Statoshi?
----------------

Statoshi's objective is to protect Bitcoin by bringing transparency to the activity 
occurring on the node network. By making this data available, Bitcoin developers can 
learn more about node performance, gain operational insight about the network, and 
the community can be informed about attacks and aberrant behavior in a timely fashion.

There is a live Grafana dashboard at [statoshi.info](http://statoshi.info)

License
-------

Statoshi is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more
information or see http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The developer [mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev)
should be used to discuss complicated or controversial changes before working
on a patch set.

Developer IRC can be found on Freenode at #bitcoin-core-dev.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run (assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`

There are also regression and integration tests of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

Every pull request is built for both Windows and Linux on a dedicated server,
and unit and sanity tests are automatically run. The binaries produced may be
used for manual QA testing â€” a link to them will appear in a comment on the
pull request posted by [BitcoinPullTester](https://github.com/BitcoinPullTester). See https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts
for the build/test scripts.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Large changes should have a test plan, and should be tested by somebody other
than the developer who wrote the code.
See https://github.com/bitcoin/QA/ for how to create a test plan.

Translations
------------

Changes to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to
[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).

Installation & Configuration
-------------------

Installation instructions can be found [here](https://jlopp.github.io/statoshi/).

A system metrics daemon is available [here](https://github.com/jlopp/bitcoin-utils/blob/master/systemMetricsDaemon.py)

Statoshi also supports running multiple nodes that emit metrics to a single graphite instance. 
In order to facilitate this, you can add a line to bitcoin.conf that will partition each 
metric by the name of the host: statshostname=yourNodeName

If you're running a fleet of nodes and you want to deduplicate peer connections between them, 
there is a [PHP daemon](https://github.com/jlopp/bitcoin-utils/tree/master/node_connection_manager) 
currently under development for this purpose.
